                                        MinerVerse is an Avalanche on-chain game inspired by a mix of our favorite childhood games, Cookie Clicker and
                                        Minecraft. To play MinerVerse, you must purchase a Miner and stake them in the Mine. Miners are ERC721 NFTs that produce
                                        an ERC20 token $DIAMOND every minute when staked.
                                    </p>
                                    <br />
                                    <p>
                                        We chose the Avalanche chain because of the fantastic community and the low gas fees, democratizing P2E, minting and
                                        trading NFTs regardless of wallet size.
                                    </p>
                                    <br />
                                    <p>
                                        Over time a player can purchase tools from simple items such as Stone Pickaxe to more complex items such as a MASSIVE
                                        Laser Beam and much more! These tools increase the player's rate of $DIAMOND mining. The goal is simple: Mine as much
                                        $DIAMOND as possible, collect more tools and miners, and dominate the MinerVerse
                                    </p>

                                        Miners are ERC721 NFTS that can be minted to start your journey into the MinerVerse. When minting, there is a 95% chance
                                        of minting a Miner, and a 5% chance of minting a Super MinerMiners mine 1 $DIAMOND per minute. Super Miners mine 5
                                        $DIAMOND per minute. You'll have to spend $DIAMOND to get craftables and improve your mine. Miners can be traded on
                                        popular sites such as NFTrade and TofuNFT.

                                            $DIAMOND and withdraw using the 2 day cooldown period.
